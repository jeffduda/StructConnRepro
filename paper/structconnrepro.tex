% Abstract Max Length = 2000 characters
Recent interest in human brain connectivity has led to the application of
graph theoretical analysis to human brain structural networks, in
particular white matter connectivity inferred from diffusion imaging
and fiber tractography. While these methods have been used to study a
variety of patient populations, there has been less examination of the
reproducibility of these methods. These graph metrics typically derive
from fiber tractography, however a number of tractography algorithms
exist and many of these are known to be sensitive to user-selected
parameters. The methods used to derive a connectivity matrix from
fiber tractography output may also influence the resulting graph
metrics. Here we examine how these algorithm and parameter choices
influence the reproducibility of proposed graph metrics on a publicly
available test-retest dataset consisting of 21 healthy young
adults. Metrics for both weighted and unweighted network summary
measures are examined using the intraclass correlation coefficient
(ICC) and Bland-Altman plots. RESULTS

%A freely available data set, the Multi-Modal MRI Reproducibility Resource, will serve as the basis for this study. ANTs, based upon ITKv4, will be used for the registration and segmentation steps needed to align and label individual brains. Camino, an open-source toolkit, will be used for: DT reconstruction, fiber tracking, and the generation of structural connectivity matrices. An ITK module will be created to implement the graph analysis metrics.

\section{Introduction}
Combining magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the human brain with graph
theory analysis has emerged as a poweful approach to studying
large-scale networks of both structural and functional
connectivity. Specifically, the use of diffusion weighted MRI and
associated fiber tractography methods provide the ability to identify
the long-range pathways that connect cortical regions and form a
network architecture~\citep{Basser2000,Lazar2003,Hagmann2003,Xue1999}. 
The use of graph theoretical analysis to study
the topology of these structural networks has increasingly been used to
examine the structural consequences of neurological disorders \citep{Xie2012}
as well as the relationship between structure and function \citep{}. 

Previous studies examining the reproducibily of graph-based metrics in
functional networks have shown good levels of repoducibily in MEG
\citep{Deuker2009}, fMRI using BOLD contrast
\citep{Telesford2010,Braun2012,Schwarz2011,Liang2012,Weber2013} and
arterial spin labeling \citep{Weber2013}. A number of studies have also examined
reproducibily in structural networks, each focusing on various aspects
of the complex processing pipeline that is a prerequesite for these
measures. These have included studies of diffusion spectrum imaging
\citep{Cammoun2012,Bassett2011N} and high angular resolution diffusion
imaging \citep{Dennis2012}. Some studies have examined probabilistic
tractography \citep{Owen2013BC,Vaessen2010}. DTI-based studies using
deterministic tractography have included the examination of
tractography seed density \citep{Cheng2012N}, anatomic label density
\citep{Bassett2011N}, and studies examining a variety of network
measures \citep{Cheng2012N,Irimia2012N}. In the paper we constrain our
analysis DTI-based deteministic fiber
tractograpy. Within this constraint, we examine multiple algortihms
for computing streamlines and their required parameters to examine
their influence on the final graph metrics. A set of manually defined
cortical parcellations \citep{Klein2012} is used along with a more common template-based
parcellation scheme \citep{AAL}. We use freely
availabe data and software to create a framework that facilitates future extensions
that may examine additional aspects of the processing as well as the
comparison to, or addition of, multiple imaging modalities.

\subsection{Neuroimaging Data}
The Multi-Modal MRI Reproducibility Resource~\citep{Landman2011}
provides a test-retest data set consisting of 21 subjects with two
time points each for which T1-weighted anatomical images and diffusion
tensor images were acquired. Other image types, not examined here,
were also acquired making this data useful for future examinations of
structure and function.  A population averaged template and manually
defined cortical labels for one time point for each subject are
available as part of the Mindboggle-101 dataset \citep{Klein2012}.

\subsection{Image Analysis}

\textbf{Minimal processing}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Intra-subject registration for label transfer
\item B0-T1 registration
\item DTI reconstruction
\item MTR ?
\end{enumerate}
For each subject, cortical labels were manually defined on the
T1-weighted image from a single time-point. In order to label the
addtional time-point, we use the ANTs Toolkit to find an affine
mapping between the T1-weighted images using the cross-correlation
metric. The cortical labels are then mapped into the unlabeled image
using nearest-neighbor interpolation.



\textbf{Optional processing}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Registration to template ( for additional label sets )
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Future processing}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Cortical thickness
\item BOLD / ASL / etc
\end{enumerate}
