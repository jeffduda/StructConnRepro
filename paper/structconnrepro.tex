Recent interest in human brain connectivity has led to the application of
graph theoretical analysis to human brain structural networks, in
particular white matter connectivity inferred from diffusion imaging
and fiber tractography. While these methods have been used to study a
variety of patient populations, there has been less examination of the
reproducibility of these methods. These graph metrics typically derive
from fiber tractography, however a number of tractography algorithms
exist and many of these are known to be sensitive to user-selected
parameters. The methods used to derive a connectivity matrix from
fiber tractography output may also influence the resulting graph
metrics. Here we examine how these algorithm and parameter choices
influence the reproducibility of proposed graph metrics on a publicly
available test-retest dataset consisting of 21 healthy young
adults. Network summary
measures are examined using the intraclass correlation coefficient
(ICC), and the dice coefficient is used to examine overlap 
of constant density subgraphs. Functional data analysis techniques are used
to examine differences in network measures that result from the choice
of fiber tracking algorithm. The global and local efficiency measures were 
the most robust to the choice of fiber tracking algorithm.

%A freely available data set, the Multi-Modal MRI Reproducibility Resource, will serve as the basis for this study. ANTs, based upon ITKv4, will be used for the registration and segmentation steps needed to align and label individual brains. Camino, an open-source toolkit, will be used for: DT reconstruction, fiber tracking, and the generation of structural connectivity matrices. An ITK module will be created to implement the graph analysis metrics.

\section{Introduction}
Combining magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the human brain with graph
theory analysis has emerged as a powerful approach to studying
large-scale networks of both structural and functional
connectivity. In the case of structural connectivity, the use of diffusion weighted MRI and
associated fiber tractography methods provide the ability to identify
the long-range pathways that connect cortical regions and form a
network architecture~\citep{Basser2000,Lazar2003,Hagmann2003,Mori1999}. 
The use of graph theoretical analysis to study
the topology of these structural networks has increasingly been used to
examine the structural consequences of neurological disorders \citep{Xie2012,Basset2012}
as well as the relationship between structure and function \citep{}. 

Previous studies examining the reproducibly of graph-based metrics in
functional networks have shown good levels of reproducibly in MEG
\citep{Deuker2009}, fMRI using BOLD contrast
\citep{Telesford2010,Braun2012,Schwarz2011,Liang2012,Weber2013} and
arterial spin labeling \citep{Weber2013}. A number of studies have also examined
reproducibly in structural networks, each focusing on various aspects
of the complex processing pipeline that is a prerequisite for these
measures. These have included studies of diffusion spectrum imaging
\citep{Cammoun2012,Bassett2011N} and high angular resolution diffusion
imaging \citep{Dennis2012}. Some studies have examined probabilistic
tractography \citep{Owen2013BC,Vaessen2010}. DTI-based studies using
deterministic tractography have included the examination of
tractography seed density \citep{Cheng2012N}, anatomic label density
\citep{Bassett2011N}, and studies examining a variety of network
measures \citep{Cheng2012N,Irimia2012N}. 

In the paper we constrain our
analysis DTI-based deterministic fiber
tractography. Within this constraint, we examine multiple algorithms
for computing streamlines and their required parameters to examine
their influence on the final graph metrics. A set of manually defined
cortical parcellations \citep{Klein2012} is used along with a more common template-based
parcellation scheme \citep{AAL}. The intraclass correlation coefficient is used to 
examine the reproducibility of network summary measures that results from combinations
of fiber tracking algorithm and anatomical label set. Functional data analysis is used
to examine how these metrics differ as a function of graph density or other parameters
that are specific to a given metric. We use freely
available data and software to create a framework that facilitates future extensions
that may examine additional aspects of the processing as well as the
comparison to, or addition of, multiple imaging modalities.

\section{Materials \& Methods}
% Materials and Methods: This section may be divided by subheadings. This section should contain sufficient detail so that when read in conjunction with cited references, all procedures can be repeated.

\subsection{Neuroimaging data}
The Multi-Modal MRI Reproducibility Resource \citep{Landman2011}
provides a publicly available test-retest data set consisting of 21
healthy control subjects (11 males). The mean
age is 31.76 $\pm$ 9.35 with a range of [22,61]. This data set provides a
multitude of MR image types, but here only the T1-weighted anatomical images and diffusion
tensor images are examined.

\subsection{Anatomical labeling}
The Mindboggle dataset provides a set of manually drawn cortical regions (DKT31) and a skull-stripped image
for a single time point for each subject \citep{Klein2012}. To utilize these labels in network creation we must perform an intrasubject
registration between T1 images and an inter modality registration from the T1 to DTI space for 
each time point. An affine registration is performed between T1 images. The brainmask is then warped into
the non-labeled time point. The Mindboggle brainmask include cerebellum and are applied to each T1 data set. The b=0
volume, acquired as part the diffusion tensor acquisition sequence is registered to the T1 image from the same acquisition. By composing
these transforms, the DKT31 labels are transferred into the DTI space for each time point using nearest neighbor interpolation. 

In addition to the DKT31 labels, the AAL label set was examined, due to it's prevalence in
the examination of both structural and functional connectivity~\citep{Tzourio-Mazoyer2002}. 
A similar registration-based approach is used to transform the AAL label in the DTI space.
An existing multivariate template had been created from the MMRR dataset using the
antsMultivariateTemplateConsturction.sh. Here we only use the T1 component of this
population-specific template. The AAL labels were transferred into the space of this template
via template-to-template registration using the antsRegistration tool. AAL labels that lie outside
of the cerebrum were excluded from later analysis. In order to transform these labels into each 
subject's T1 space, the antsCorticalThickness.sh tool was used. This software first applies bias
correction using the N4 algorithm. Next a registration based skull stripping is performed to provide
a cerebrum mask of the T1 image. This is followed by a final cerebrum-only registration to the template.
Composing the appropriate transforms again provides a method to transfer these labels in the DTI space for each time point. 
As the AAL labels include both gray and white matter, they are masked to only include voxels 
that have been identified as cortical gray matter by the DKT31 labels.

%ANTs volumetric-based cortical thickness estimation pipeline

%The N4 tool was used to perform bias correction on each subject's T1
%image \citep{Tustison????}. The antsRegistration tool was used to find
%a deformable mapping between each subject's T1 and the Mindboggle
%template for later use in anatomical labeling. An intra subject affine
%registration was used to align each subject's T1 images. Thresholding
%and a morphological closing was
%used to obtain a brainmask from the brain extracted T1 images provided
%by Mindboggle. 

%For each subject, a set of manually defined cortical labels was
%available via Mindboggle \citep{Klein2012}. Additionally, the AAL label set
%\citep{Tzourio-Mazoyer2002} was also examined
%as it is a label set often used in both functional and structural
%studies. Here a template-based approach is used and the
%antsRegistration tool is used to find a deformable mapping to the
%Mindboggle template. These template mapping are then combined with the
%intrasubject mapping to transfer the AAL labels into the DTI space for
%each time point.

\subsection{Diffusion data preprocessing}
The Camino toolkit \citep{} is used to calculate diffusion tensor images via a
weighted linear fitting \citep{Basser1994,Salvador2005}, and is also
used for subsequent deterministic tractography. The brainmasks defined
in anatomical space are warped into DTI space and are used to restrict the
tractography to eliminate false positives that could results from
streamlines that leave and then reenter the brain. Fractional anisotropy (FA) images are calculated and a
tractography seed-map is created by including all voxels in the cerebrum with an FA of at
least 0.2. 

%These seed-maps are then resampled to a resolution of 0.5mm x 0.5mm x
%0.5mm to provide a dense seeding as this has been shown to increase stability of
%structural network metrics ~\citep{Cheng2012}. 

One of the primary differences among the various approaches to
deterministic tractography is the algorithm used to determine the
direction that a streamline should proceed from a given point. Here we
examine four different approaches:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Fiber Assignment by Continuous Tracking (FACT) - The primary
  direction of diffusion (PDD) is followed until the streamline enters
  a new voxel \citep{Mori1999}.
\item Euler -  The PDD is followed for a constant step size \citep{Basser2000}.
\item Rourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) - The direction of the step is determined
 by taking and averaging a weighted series of partial steps \citep{Basser2000}.
\item Tensor Deflection (TEND) - The entire diffusion tensor is used to deﬂect
the estimated ﬁber trajectory \citep{Lazar2003}
\end{enumerate}

Shared parameters used in the fiber tracking were held constant as follows
\begin{enumerate}
\item Streamlines were terminated if curvature of more than 90 degrees over 5 steps was detected. 
\item Streamlines were terminated in an FA value of less of 0.2 was encountered. 
\item A step size of 0.5mm was used. 
\item Linear interpolation of the primary direction of diffusion was used for Euler and RK4. 
\end{enumerate}

%Additionally we examine the weighting parameters used in the TEND
%algorithm

\subsection{Graph generation}
For a given set of streamlines, the connmat tool provided by  the Camino toolkit was used to generate
a connectivity matrix that records how many streamlines connect each pair of
regions in a given set of target regions. This program starts at the seed point for a streamline and proceeds outward in each
direction to determines the two target regions encountered. Only streamlines that connect two unique regions are retained and
a given streamline may be only be counted as connecting a single pair of target regions. 

To compare graphs it is necessary to first ensure that the graphs are of equal density, where density for an undirected graph is defined as:
$$D(G) = \frac{\|E(G)\|}{( \|N(G)\| (\|N(G)\|-1) )} $$
where $N(G)$ is the set of all nodes in graph $G$ and $E(G)$ is the set of all edges in $G$. To obtain constant density graphs, the $M$ highest weighted edges are retained and all other edges are removed where $M$ is fully determined by the desired density and number of nodes in the graph. This cumulative thresholding provides a normalized method for comparing network measures as it results in the comparison of graphs with an equal percentage of significant connections. Here, we only directly compare measures obtained from graphs with an equal number of nodes.

%Additionally, we generative matrices
%that record the average FA along all tracts that connect a given pair
%of regions. In both cases, the matrices may be thresholded for
%unweighted graph metrics or used as is for weighted graph metrics.

\subsection{Network metrics}
%As we are interested in whole network summary measures, we examine the mean
%over all nodes for each of the node-metrics listed in
%table \label{tab:nodes}. For more details on the node metrics see
A large number of metric are available for quantifying properties of binary, undirected networks \citep{Rubinov2010}. Here we examine a number that 
are common in current literature: largest connected component size \citep{Basset2011}, assortativity\citep{Newwan2006,Basset2008}, clustering coefficient \citep{Watts1998}, characteristic path length\citep{Watts1998}, global and local efficiency \citep{Latora2001}, and rich club coefficient\citep{RichClub}. An ITK module named Petiole (https://github.com/jeffduda/Petiole) was created to calculate these network measures from 2D connectivity
matrices \citep{Petiole}. This module incorporates and extends an existing implementation of a graph class \citep{NickITKJournal} and provides ITK functions for a variety of graph metrics while using the matlab-based Brain Connectivity Toolkit \citep{BCT} for algorithmic guidance. While many of these metrics include implementations for weighted graphs and/or directed graphs, here we focus on their application to unweighted, undirected graphs. Summaries and equations for these metrics are provided here:

\emph{Size of Largest Connected Component}.  A connected component of a graph is a subset of the graph, $G_{i}$, where there exists a path between all pairs of nodes and for which no path exist to additional nodes in $G$. The largest connected component is the $G_{i}$ with the greatest number of nodes, $\|N(G_{i}\|$. This measure relates to the global level of connectivity within a subject's brain network~\cite{Basset2011}.


\emph{Assortativity}. Assortativity measures how preferentially nodes of similar degree connect to one another \citep{Newman2006} and is defined as:
$$A =  \frac{ \frac{1}{E} \sum_{i}{j_i k_i} - [ \frac{1}{E} \sum_{i}{ \frac{1}{2} (j_i + k_i)} ]^2 }{ \frac{1}{E} \sum_{i}{ \frac{1}{2}( j_{i}^{2} + k_{i}^{2} ) } - [ \frac{1}{E} \sum_{i}{ \frac{1}{2} (j_i + k_i)} ]^2  } $$
where $j_i,k_i$ are the degrees of the nodes connected by edge $i$ and $E = \|E(G)\|$.

\emph{Clustering Coefficient}. This measure quantifies how likely is that two nodes with a common neighbor are connected to one another ~\citep{Watts1998}. Here we calculate the clustering coefficient at each node and calculate the mean over all nodes in the network for our final network summary measure. The clustering coefficient at node $i$ is given by:
$$C_i = \frac{e_i}{\|K_i\| ( \|K_i\| -1 )}$$
where $K_i$ is the set of all nodes that share an edge with $i$ and $e_i$ is the set of all edges that connect nodes in $K_i$.

\emph{Characteristic Path Length}. The pathlength, $L_{ij}$, that connects two nodes, $i$ and $j$, is defined as the minimum number of edges that must be traversed to travel from $i$ to $j$ \citep{Dijkstra1959}. The characteristic path length is the average pathlength over all possible pairs of connections in a graph. In an undirected graph this is:
$$L = \frac{1}{\|N(G)\|(\|N(G)\|-1)} \sum_{ij \in G, i \neq j}{L_{ij}}$$
This measure is only defined for fully connected graphs. Here, we apply the density thresholding first and then extract the largest connected component in order to calculate the characteristic path length.

\emph{Global Efficiency}. This measure is related to the characteristic path length, in that it attempts to quantify the mean efficiency between any two nodes in the graph. However, this metric is defined for both connected unconnected graphs \citep{Latora2001}.
$$F_{glob} = \frac{1}{\|N(G)\|(\|N(G)\|-1)} \sum_{i \neq j \in G}{1/L_{ij}}$$


\emph{Local Efficiency}. This metric relates to fault tolerance and examines efficiency between neighbors on a node $i$, if that node were removed from the graph \citep{Latora2001}.
$$F_{loc} = \frac{1}{\|N(G)\|} \sum_{i \in n}{F(G_i)}$$
where $G_i$ is the subgraph of $G$ that results from removing node $i$.

\emph{Rich Club Coefficient}
This measures quantifies how preferentially the high-degree nodes (i.e. rich nodes)  in a graph connect to other high-degree nodes \citep{RichClub}.
$$ R(G,k) = \frac{ \|E(G,k)\| }{ \|N(G,k)\| ( \|N(G,k)\|-1 ) } $$
where $N(G,k)$ is the set of nodes of degree k or higher and $E(G,k)$ is the set of edges connecting two nodes in $N(G,k)$.


\subsection{Graph curves}
The metrics listed above are all applied to thresholded binary graphs. As discussed earlier, this binary graph result from thresholding at a constant density. These metrics may then be treated as functional curves of metric vs. graph density. By doing this, we are able to compare binary graphs in a way that incorporates the continuous structure of the original connectivity matrices. The rich club coefficient however is dependent upon two parameters, the graph density and, $k$, the degree threshold used to determined what constitutes a rich-node. For this metric we threshold at the highest density common to all graphs and explore how the value changes with $k$. For all other metrics, we examine their curves as a function of graph density. 

\subsection{Statistical analysis}
Before examining how the graph metrics change with density it is necessary to examine the maximum density of the graphs to determine the range over which graph curves may be compared. Additionally, it is interesting to examine the topological similarity in the thresholded graphs. This is done using the dice coefficient which measures similarity between two graphs as:
$$Dice(x,y) = \frac{ 2 \| E(x) \cap E(y) \| }{ \|E(x) \| + \| E(y) |\ }$$
where edges are considered equal if they connect the same two nodes. The mean intra- and inter-subject topological similarity 
was computed over a range of densities for each combination of tracking algorithm and anatomical label sets. This allows us to 
examine the reproducibility of within-subject topography compared to between subject topography. This metric is limited to lie in the range $[0,1]$ and can be interpreted as a measure of degree of overlap between graphs. This provides a stricter metric than measuring overlap between sets of nodes as complete node-overlap is a necessary but incomplete condition for complete edge-overlap.

Graph curves are used to examine the reproducibly of the graph metrics as a function of an independent parameter, typically graph density. At each point along the curve, reproducibility of the metric is quantified using the ICC:
$$ICC = \frac{\sigma_{bs}^{2}}{\sigma_{bs}^{2} + \sigma_{ws}^{2}} $$
where $\sigma_{bs}^{2}$ is the between-subject variance and $\sigma_{ws}^{2}$ is the within subject variance. The 'ICC' package for  \R{} is used for this calculation. The ICC is plotted along with the mean graph metrics for each combination of algorithm and label set. At points where little to no variance exists in a graph metric, the ICC is not calculated as it becomes unstable under those conditions. The following guidelines may be used to interpret ICC values: ICC $<$ 0.2 'poor agreement'; 0.21 - 0.40 'fair agreement'; 0.41-0.60 moderate agreement; 0.61-0.80 'strong agreement'; ICC $>$ 0.8 'near perfect agrement \citep{Telesford2010,Montgomery2002}. Dashed lines indicating the boundaries of these categories have been included on all ICC plots to aid interpretation.

To identify group diferences that result from fiber tracking algorithm we incorporated methods from functional data analysis which treats each curve as a function. While there are a variety of methods for computing the difference between two curves, here we choose the simplest method, the non-parametric permutation test. We first treat each mean curve as a function and find the area between a pair of curves. We then permute group assignment of individuals used to calculate the mean curves using random sampling without replacement. We then calculate new mean curves from the randomly assigned groups and measure the area between these curves. This it performed iteratively (i=100000). We record, x, the number of times area between the mean curves from the randomly assigned groups is larger than the area between the true group mean curves. The p-value for the true group difference is then defined as $x/i$. We report these differences for between-algorithm curves as they derive from graph of equal size, but do compare curves that derive from different anatomical label sets.

\subsection{Network density}
Maximal densities for connectivity matrices across all tracking algorithm ranged from 0.17 to 0.30 for the AAL labels and from 0.20 to 0.41 for DKT31. Maximal densities in the DTK31 data was generally higher than in the AAL as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:density}. Both label sets had the same lowest-to-highest ordering of mean maximal density within algorithms: RK4 $<$ Euler $<$ FACT $<$ TEND.

\subsection{Network topology}
Dice coefficients for intra-subject similarity ranged from 0.70 to 0.81 for the AAL labels and from 0.59 to 0.82 for the DTK31 labels. Inter-subject similarity ranged from 0.51 to 0.71 for AAL labels and from 0.32 to 0.71 for the DTK31 labels. For all algorithm-label pairings, intra-subject overlap was greater than inter-subject overlap across the range of densities as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:dice}. Permutation testing of intra-subject dice vs. density curves did not reveal any significant differences between algorithms for either label set. However, a number of differences were found in the inter-subject comparions. The resulting p-values are listed in table \ref{tab:dicep}.

\subsection{Network summary measures over graph density}
For each combination of tracking and label set, the mean curves that were calculated to examine how the metrics change as a 
function of graph density are illustrated in figure \ref{fig:vsdensity} along with the ICC curves that quantify reproducibility. While
no direct comparisons were done between graph curves generated from different label sets, the scales of the plots are equal to 
allow for convenient visual comparison. Only the characteristic path length curves exhibit a different shape between label sets, and
only at low density values. This is likely a results of the smaller number of regions in DKT31 label set. Clustering coefficient, and
global and local efficiency exhibit the most similarity across label sets. Comparing within metric and within label set, the fiber tracking
algorithms appear consistent as far as shape. Functional data analysis, along with permutation testing does reveal a number of significant
differences between graph curves however, as listed in table \ref{tab:permtesting}. No significant differences were found between 
tracking algorithms using the DKT31 labels. Within the AAL labels, significant differences were found between RK4 and TEND for four 
of the six metrics examined.

\subsection{Rich club coefficient over node-degree}
Because the rich club coefficient requires the selection of multiple parameters, we chose to examine how this metric
changes as a function of $k$, the node degree that determines what is considered a 'rich' node. The plots for the
mean graph curves and ICC coefficients are illustrated in figure \ref{fig:richclub}. The results are similar to the examinations
over graph density in that the same shape appears for both label sets, but with an scaling difference and the tracking algorithms
have similar shapes but within the AAL networks, differences were found in the RK4-FACT (p$=$0.0338) and RK4-TEND (p$=$0.0252) 
comparisons. The p-values for all comparisons are listed in table \ref{tab:richp}

\subsection{Network topology}
Although a number of studies have examined the reproducibility of graph metrics on 
structural brain networks derived from DTI-based fiber tractography, there are no known 
papers that focus on the selection of deterministic tracking algorithm. To facilitate later examination of
graph metrics as a function of graph density, we first examined the reliability of identifying
subgraphs by thresholding. Using the dice coefficient as a measure of overlap we demonstrated
that the intra subject agreement was much higher than the inter subject agreement across all tracking algorithms and 
label sets. Using the AAL label set we demonstrated differences in topology between FACT and TEND which suggest
that the TEND algorithm may provide a more reproducible measure of network topology across subjects. This is significant as the AAL
labels are prevalent throughout all forms of connectivity studies and the FACT algorithm is the most common choice
among deterministic tractography methods. However, further analysis of additional tracking parameters is 
necessary to determine the full set of conditions under which this difference holds.

\subsection{Network summary measures over graph density}
Global and local efficiency are the most robust to choice of fiber tracking algorithm, and have high levels 
of reprocibily across density levels. Assortativity and characteristic path length are highly repoducible across
density levels, but are sensitive to choice of fiber tracking algorithm. In general, the portions of the graph curves
at low density value and less reproducible than the segments at high density. 

\subsection{Rich club coefficient over node-degree}
The examination of rich club coefficient as a function of degree-level demonstrates the use of graph curves over 
a parameter other than graph density. Consistency appears to have a somewhat inverse relationship to the x
coefficient as a function of node degree level. This is a result of the fact that the rich club coefficient values converge
at high and low densitites. Here, all graphs were thresholded at the maximum density achievable by all graphs. As the average node degree would drop with lowered
density, additional work is required to more thoroughly understand the relationship between graph-density and degree-level that 
would provide the most reproducible results. 

\subsection{Limitations and future directions}
The are a number of methodological limitations to the work presented here. We limited the fiber tracking to deterministic
methods and used constant shared parameters for these methods. The influence of these parameters on individual 
tracking algorithms and the resulting graph metrics demands further exploration. In the choice of anatomical label sets, we
limited the analysis to a set of manually defined labels, and a often used set of template-based labels. In each case we used the label
'as-is' without upsampling to a higher number of regions. 

An additional limitation of this work is the use of streamline count matrices as the basis for thresholding to create constant
density graphs. Multiple options exist for normalizing the streamline count matrices using the volumes of 
the target cortical regions and/or the average length of the streamlines the connect two regions. The volume based
normalization may accomodate the differences that are seen between graph curves that were generated using 
the different anatomical labels. However, the focus here was on the influence of the fiber tracking and no direct
comparisons were made between graph curves generated from the different label sets. A number of additional options
exist for creating a weighted connectivity matrix inluding the averge FA of fibers that connect two regions. Since the data set
examined also includes magenetization transfer data, the average magnetization transfer ratio along streamlines 
could potentially be useful as it directly related to myelin content in white matter. These issues were beyond the scope 
of the current study but would made for an intriguing extension of the current work. 

The selection of graph metrics for analysis is another limitation of the study. An exhaustive examination of all
possible graph metrics was not feasible so metrics that have been studied previously were chosen to give additional
context to existing work. Many of the metrics examined have alternate formulations for 
weighted graphs. Here, only unweighted graph metrics were examined as they are prevelant in current literature.
 The creation of a testing framework that relies upon a public data set and open-source code
was intended to facilitate the further exploration of the issues listed here.

\subsection{Conclusion}
This study evaluate the reproducibility of graph summary metrics in structural brain networks derived from
DTI based deterministic fiber tractography. Four differenent fiber tracking algorithms were examined along
with two different anatomical label set. A number of graph metrics were examined by creating graph curves that capture how a metric
changes over a parameter such as graph density. ICC plots were used to evaluate the reprociblity of the metrics and FDA
was used to indentify significant differences between graph curves generated using different fiber tracking algorithms.
While differenences between the tracking algorithms were not drastic, they were significant in many cases, suggesting
that future studies should give careful consideration to the choice of fiber tracking algorithm based upon the graph
metric that will be analyzed.
