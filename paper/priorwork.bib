  abstract = {Brain anatomical networks are sparse, complex, and have economical
	small-world properties. We investigated the efficiency and cost of
	human brain functional networks measured using functional magnetic
	resonance imaging (fMRI) in a factorial design: two groups of healthy
	old (N = 11; mean age = 66.5 years) and healthy young (N = 15; mean
	age = 24.7 years) volunteers were each scanned twice in a no-task
	or "resting" state following placebo or a single dose of a dopamine
	receptor antagonist (sulpiride 400 mg). Functional connectivity between
	90 cortical and subcortical regions was estimated by wavelet correlation
	analysis, in the frequency interval 0.06-0.11 Hz, and thresholded
	to construct undirected graphs. These brain functional networks were
	small-world and economical in the sense of providing high global
	and local efficiency of parallel information processing for low connection
	cost. Efficiency was reduced disproportionately to cost in older
	people, and the detrimental effects of age on efficiency were localised
	to frontal and temporal cortical and subcortical regions. Dopamine
	antagonism also impaired global and local efficiency of the network,
	but this effect was differentially localised and did not interact
	with the effect of age. Brain functional networks have economical
	small-world properties-supporting efficient parallel information
	transfer at relatively low cost-which are differently impaired by
	normal aging and pharmacological blockade of dopamine transmission.},

	They also displayed signatures of topo-physical interdependence such
	as Rentian scaling. Basic connectivity properties and several graph
	metrics consistently displayed high reproducibility and low variability

  abstract = {Structural brain networks were constructed based on diffusion tensor
	imaging (DTI) data of 59 young healthy male adults. The networks
	had 68 nodes, derived from FreeSurfer parcellation of the cortical
	surface. By means of streamline tractography, the edge weight was
	defined as the number of streamlines between two nodes normalized
	by their mean volume. Specifically, two weighting schemes were adopted
	by considering various biases from fiber tracking. The weighting
	schemes were tested for possible bias toward the physical size of
	the nodes. A novel thresholding method was proposed using the variance
	of number of streamlines in fiber tracking. The backbone networks
	were extracted and various network analyses were applied to investigate
	the features of the binary and weighted backbone networks. For weighted
	networks, a high correlation was observed between nodal strength
	and betweenness centrality. Despite similar small-worldness features,
	binary networks and weighted networks are distinctive in many aspects,
	such as modularity and nodal betweenness centrality. Inter-subject
	variability was examined for the weighted networks, along with the
	test-retest reliability from two repeated scans on 44 of the 59 subjects.
	The inter-/intra-subject variability of weighted networks was discussed
	in three levels - edge weights, local metrics, and global metrics.
	The variance of edge weights can be very large. Although local metrics
	show less variability than the edge weights, they still have considerable
	amounts of variability. Weighting scheme one, which scales the number
	of streamlines by their lengths, demonstrates stable intra-class
	correlation coefficients against thresholding for global efficiency,
	clustering coefficient and diversity. The intra-class correlation
	analysis suggests the current approach of constructing weighted network
	has a reasonably high reproducibility for most global metrics.},

	various brain regions as nodes and fiber tracts connecting those

	can be affected by noise in the scans and the choice of tractography

	variance of the network was characterized using an approach similar
	to the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) standards
	for measurement of image noise. It was shown that the variance of

	Consequently, the number of seeds has a large impact on local characteristics
	and metrics of the network architecture. As the number of seeds increased,
	increased stability of structural network metrics was observed. However,
	more seeds can also lead to more spurious fibers and thus affect
	nodal degrees and edge weights, and proper thresholding may be necessary
	to create an appropriate weighted network. Because the variance of
	the network is also influenced by other imaging factors, further
	increase in the number of seeds has little effect in reducing the

  abstract = {Though it is widely appreciated that complex structural, functional
	and morphological relationships exist between distinct areas of the
	human cerebral cortex, the extent to which such relationships coincide
	remains insufficiently appreciated. Here we determine the extent
	to which correlations between brain regions are modulated by either
	structural, connectomic or network-theoretic properties using a structural
	neuroimaging data set of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion
	tensor imaging (DTI) volumes acquired from N=110 healthy human adults.
	To identify the linear relationships between all available pairs
	of regions, we use canonical correlation analysis to test whether
	a statistically significant correlation exists between each pair
	of cortical parcels as quantified via structural, connectomic or
	network-theoretic measures. In addition to this, we investigate (1)
	how each group of canonical variables (whether structural, connectomic
	or network-theoretic) contributes to the overall correlation and,
	additionally, (2) whether each individual variable makes a significant
	contribution to the test of the omnibus null hypothesis according
	to which no correlation between regions exists across subjects. We
	find that, although region-to-region correlations are extensively
	modulated by structural and connectomic measures, there are appreciable

  abstract = {Modern MRI image processing methods have yielded quantitative, morphometric,
	functional, and structural assessments of the human brain. These
	analyses typically exploit carefully optimized protocols for specific
	imaging targets. Algorithm investigators have several excellent public
	data resources to use to test, develop, and optimize their methods.
	Recently, there has been an increasing focus on combining MRI protocols
	in multi-parametric studies. Notably, these have included innovative
	approaches for fusing connectivity inferences with functional and/or
	anatomical characterizations. Yet, validation of the reproducibility
	of these interesting and novel methods has been severely hampered
	by the limited availability of appropriate multi-parametric data.
	We present an imaging protocol optimized to include state-of-the-art
	assessment of brain function, structure, micro-architecture, and
	quantitative parameters within a clinically feasible 60-min protocol
	on a 3-T MRI scanner. We present scan-rescan reproducibility of these
	imaging contrasts based on 21 healthy volunteers (11 M/10 F, 22-61
	years old). The cortical gray matter, cortical white matter, ventricular
	cerebrospinal fluid, thalamus, putamen, caudate, cerebellar gray
	matter, cerebellar white matter, and brainstem were identified with
	mean volume-wise reproducibility of 3.5\%. We tabulate the mean intensity,
	variability, and reproducibility of each contrast in a region of
	interest approach, which is essential for prospective study planning
	and retrospective power analysis considerations. Anatomy was highly
	consistent on structural acquisition (~1-5\% variability), while
	variation on diffusion and several other quantitative scans was higher
	(~<10\%). Some sequences are particularly variable in specific structures
	(ASL exhibited variation of 28\% in the cerebral white matter) or
	in thin structures (quantitative T2 varied by up to 73\% in the caudate)
	due, in large part, to variability in automated ROI placement. The
	richness of the joint distribution of intensities across imaging
	methods can be best assessed within the context of a particular analysis
	approach as opposed to a summary table. As such, all imaging data
	and analysis routines have been made publicly and freely available.
	This effort provides the neuroimaging community with a resource for
	optimization of algorithms that exploit the diversity of modern MRI
	modalities. Additionally, it establishes a baseline for continuing
	development and optimization of multi-parametric imaging protocols.},

	for the diagnosis, outcome prediction, and treatment monitoring of
	many common neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative
	disorders for which there is currently no clinical utility for MR

	guide the study design and the interpretation of longitudinal data.
	In this work, the reproducibility of commonly used graph theoretic
	measures is investigated, as applied to the structural connectome
	of healthy adult volunteers. Two datasets are examined, one consisting
	of 10 subjects scanned twice at one MRI facility and one consisting
	of five subjects scanned once each at two different facilities using
	the same imaging platform. Global graph metrics are calculated for
	unweighed and weighed connectomes, and two levels of granularity
	of the connectome are evaluated: one based on the 82-node cortical
	and subcortical parcellation from FreeSurfer and one based on an
	atlas-free parcellation of the gray-white matter boundary consisting
	of 1000 cortical nodes. The consistency of the unweighed and weighed
	edges and the module assignments are also computed for the 82-node
	connectomes. Overall, the results demonstrate good-to-excellent test-retest
	reliability for the entire connectome-processing pipeline, including
	the graph analytics, in both the intrasite and intersite datasets.
	These findings indicate that measurements of computational network
	metrics derived from the structural connectome have sufficient precision
	to be tested as potential biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and

	these difficulties. We discuss the initial graph definition of unweighted
	graphs via fixed thresholds, average degrees or edge densities, and
	the use of weighted graphs. For instance, choosing a threshold to
	fix N and k does eliminate size and density effects but may lead
	to modifications of the network by enforcing (ignoring) non-significant
	(significant) connections. Opposed to fixing N and k, graph measures
	are often normalized via random surrogates but, in fact, this may
	even increase the sensitivity to differences in N and k for the commonly
	used clustering coefficient and small-world index. To avoid such
	a bias we tried to estimate the N,k-dependence for empirical networks,
	which can serve to correct for size effects, if successful. We also
	add a number of methods used in social sciences that build on statistics
	of local network structures including exponential random graph models
	and motif counting. We show that none of the here-investigated methods
	allows for a reliable and fully unbiased comparison, but some perform
	better than others.},

  abstract = {Networks of coupled dynamical systems have been used to model biological
	oscillators, Josephson junction arrays, excitable media, neural networks,
	spatial games, genetic control networks and many other self-organizing
	systems. Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either
	completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological
	and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here
	we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this
	middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing
	amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered,
	like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths,
	like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy
	with the small-world phenomenon (popularly known as six degrees of
	separation. The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans,
	the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration
	graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models
	of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation
	speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular,
	infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than
	in regular lattices.},

  abstract = {AlzheimerÂs disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. As
	an incurable, progressive and neurodegenerative disease, it causes
	cognitive and memory deficits. However, the biological mechanisms
	underlying the disease are not thoroughly understood. In recent years,
	non-invasive neuroimaging and neurophysiological techniques (e.g.,
	structural MRI, diffusion MRI, functional MRI and EEG/MEG) and graph
	theory based network analysis have provided a new perspective on
	structural and functional connectivity patterns of the human brain
	(i.e., the human connectome) in health and disease. Using these powerful
	approaches, several recent studies of patients with AD exhibited
	abnormal topological organization in both global and regional properties
	of neuronal networks, indicating that AD not only affects specific
	brain regions, but also alters the structural and functional associations
	between distinct brain regions. Specifically, disruptive organization
	in the whole-brain networks in AD is involved in the loss of small-world
	characters and the re-organization of hub distributions. These aberrant
	neuronal connectivity patterns were associated with cognitive deficits
	in patients with AD, even with genetic factors in healthy aging.
	These studies provide empirical evidence to support the existence
	of an aberrant connectome of AD. In this review we will summarize
	recent advances discovered in large-scale brain network studies of
	AD, mainly focusing on graph theoretical analysis of brain connectivity
	abnormalities. These studies provide novel insights into the pathophysiological
	mechanisms of AD and could be helpful in developing imaging biomarkers
	for disease diagnosis and monitoring.},

	reconstruction of axonal projections can be achieved using a rapid

	the location of these known axonal projections. The experiment took
	2 hr and shorter times should be possible in the clinical situation.
	By combining anisotropy information with fiber tracking, the anisotropy
	of individual projections was also documented. Magn Reson Med 42:1123-1127,
