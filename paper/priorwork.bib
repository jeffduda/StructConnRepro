  abstract = {Brain anatomical networks are sparse, complex, and have economical
	small-world properties. We investigated the efficiency and cost of
	human brain functional networks measured using functional magnetic
	resonance imaging (fMRI) in a factorial design: two groups of healthy
	old (N = 11; mean age = 66.5 years) and healthy young (N = 15; mean
	age = 24.7 years) volunteers were each scanned twice in a no-task
	or "resting" state following placebo or a single dose of a dopamine
	receptor antagonist (sulpiride 400 mg). Functional connectivity between
	90 cortical and subcortical regions was estimated by wavelet correlation
	analysis, in the frequency interval 0.06-0.11 Hz, and thresholded
	to construct undirected graphs. These brain functional networks were
	small-world and economical in the sense of providing high global
	and local efficiency of parallel information processing for low connection
	cost. Efficiency was reduced disproportionately to cost in older
	people, and the detrimental effects of age on efficiency were localised
	to frontal and temporal cortical and subcortical regions. Dopamine
	antagonism also impaired global and local efficiency of the network,
	but this effect was differentially localised and did not interact
	with the effect of age. Brain functional networks have economical
	small-world properties-supporting efficient parallel information
	transfer at relatively low cost-which are differently impaired by
	normal aging and pharmacological blockade of dopamine transmission.},

  abstract = {Whole-brain network analysis of diffusion imaging tractography data
	is an important new tool for quantification of differential connectivity
	patterns across individuals and between groups. Here we investigate
	both the conservation of network architectural properties across
	methodological variation and the reproducibility of individual architecture
	across multiple scanning sessions. Diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI)
	and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were both acquired in triplicate
	from a cohort of healthy young adults. Deterministic tractography
	was performed on each dataset and inter-regional connectivity matrices
	were then derived by applying each of three widely used whole-brain
	parcellation schemes over a range of spatial resolutions. Across
	acquisitions and preprocessing streams, anatomical brain networks
	were found to be sparsely connected, hierarchical, and assortative.
	They also displayed signatures of topo-physical interdependence such
	as Rentian scaling. Basic connectivity properties and several graph
	metrics consistently displayed high reproducibility and low variability
	in both DSI and DTI networks. The relative increased sensitivity
	of DSI to complex fiber configurations was evident in increased tract
	counts and network density compared with DTI. In combination, this
	pattern of results shows that network analysis of human white matter
	connectivity provides sensitive and temporally stable topological

  abstract = {Structural brain networks were constructed based on diffusion tensor
	imaging (DTI) data of 59 young healthy male adults. The networks
	had 68 nodes, derived from FreeSurfer parcellation of the cortical
	surface. By means of streamline tractography, the edge weight was
	defined as the number of streamlines between two nodes normalized
	by their mean volume. Specifically, two weighting schemes were adopted
	by considering various biases from fiber tracking. The weighting
	schemes were tested for possible bias toward the physical size of
	the nodes. A novel thresholding method was proposed using the variance
	of number of streamlines in fiber tracking. The backbone networks
	were extracted and various network analyses were applied to investigate
	the features of the binary and weighted backbone networks. For weighted
	networks, a high correlation was observed between nodal strength
	and betweenness centrality. Despite similar small-worldness features,
	binary networks and weighted networks are distinctive in many aspects,
	such as modularity and nodal betweenness centrality. Inter-subject
	variability was examined for the weighted networks, along with the
	test-retest reliability from two repeated scans on 44 of the 59 subjects.
	The inter-/intra-subject variability of weighted networks was discussed
	in three levels - edge weights, local metrics, and global metrics.
	The variance of edge weights can be very large. Although local metrics
	show less variability than the edge weights, they still have considerable
	amounts of variability. Weighting scheme one, which scales the number
	of streamlines by their lengths, demonstrates stable intra-class
	correlation coefficients against thresholding for global efficiency,
	clustering coefficient and diversity. The intra-class correlation
	analysis suggests the current approach of constructing weighted network
	has a reasonably high reproducibility for most global metrics.},

  abstract = {Though it is widely appreciated that complex structural, functional

	remains insufficiently appreciated. Here we determine the extent
	to which correlations between brain regions are modulated by either
	structural, connectomic or network-theoretic properties using a structural
	neuroimaging data set of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion
	tensor imaging (DTI) volumes acquired from N=110 healthy human adults.
	To identify the linear relationships between all available pairs
	of regions, we use canonical correlation analysis to test whether
	a statistically significant correlation exists between each pair
	of cortical parcels as quantified via structural, connectomic or
	network-theoretic measures. In addition to this, we investigate (1)
	how each group of canonical variables (whether structural, connectomic

	additionally, (2) whether each individual variable makes a significant
	contribution to the test of the omnibus null hypothesis according
	to which no correlation between regions exists across subjects. We
	find that, although region-to-region correlations are extensively
	modulated by structural and connectomic measures, there are appreciable
	differences in how these two groups of measures drive inter-regional
	correlation patterns. Additionally, our results indicate that the
	network-theoretic properties of the cortex are strong modulators

	the structural and connectomic relationship between various parts

  abstract = {Abstract Structural magnetic resonance (MR) connectomics holds promise
	for the diagnosis, outcome prediction, and treatment monitoring of
	many common neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative
	disorders for which there is currently no clinical utility for MR
	imaging (MRI). Before computational network metrics from the human
	connectome can be applied in a clinical setting, their precision
	and their normative intersubject variation must be understood to
	guide the study design and the interpretation of longitudinal data.
	In this work, the reproducibility of commonly used graph theoretic
	measures is investigated, as applied to the structural connectome
	of healthy adult volunteers. Two datasets are examined, one consisting
	of 10 subjects scanned twice at one MRI facility and one consisting
	of five subjects scanned once each at two different facilities using
	the same imaging platform. Global graph metrics are calculated for
	unweighed and weighed connectomes, and two levels of granularity
	of the connectome are evaluated: one based on the 82-node cortical
	and subcortical parcellation from FreeSurfer and one based on an
	atlas-free parcellation of the gray-white matter boundary consisting
	of 1000 cortical nodes. The consistency of the unweighed and weighed
	edges and the module assignments are also computed for the 82-node
	connectomes. Overall, the results demonstrate good-to-excellent test-retest
	reliability for the entire connectome-processing pipeline, including
	the graph analytics, in both the intrasite and intersite datasets.
	These findings indicate that measurements of computational network
	metrics derived from the structural connectome have sufficient precision
	to be tested as potential biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and
	monitoring of interventions in neurological and psychiatric diseases.},

	with the small-world phenomenon (popularly known as six degrees of
	separation. The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans,
	the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration
	graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models
