  abstract = {Brain anatomical networks are sparse, complex, and have economical
	small-world properties. We investigated the efficiency and cost of
	human brain functional networks measured using functional magnetic
	resonance imaging (fMRI) in a factorial design: two groups of healthy
	old (N = 11; mean age = 66.5 years) and healthy young (N = 15; mean
	age = 24.7 years) volunteers were each scanned twice in a no-task
	or "resting" state following placebo or a single dose of a dopamine
	receptor antagonist (sulpiride 400 mg). Functional connectivity between
	90 cortical and subcortical regions was estimated by wavelet correlation
	analysis, in the frequency interval 0.06-0.11 Hz, and thresholded
	to construct undirected graphs. These brain functional networks were
	small-world and economical in the sense of providing high global
	and local efficiency of parallel information processing for low connection
	cost. Efficiency was reduced disproportionately to cost in older
	people, and the detrimental effects of age on efficiency were localised
	to frontal and temporal cortical and subcortical regions. Dopamine
	antagonism also impaired global and local efficiency of the network,
	but this effect was differentially localised and did not interact
	with the effect of age. Brain functional networks have economical
	small-world properties-supporting efficient parallel information
	transfer at relatively low cost-which are differently impaired by
	normal aging and pharmacological blockade of dopamine transmission.},

  abstract = {The human brain is a topologically complex network embedded in anatomical
	space. Here, we systematically explored relationships between functional
	connectivity, complex network topology, and anatomical (Euclidean)
	distance between connected brain regions, in the resting-state functional
	magnetic resonance imaging brain networks of 20 healthy volunteers
	and 19 patients with childhood-onset schizophrenia (COS). Normal
	between-subject differences in average distance of connected edges
	in brain graphs were strongly associated with variation in topological
	properties of functional networks. In addition, a club or subset
	of connector hubs was identified, in lateral temporal, parietal,
	dorsal prefrontal, and medial prefrontal/cingulate cortical regions.
	In COS, there was reduced strength of functional connectivity over
	short distances especially, and therefore, global mean connection
	distance of thresholded graphs was significantly greater than normal.
	As predicted from relationships between spatial and topological properties
	of normal networks, this disorder-related proportional increase in
	connection distance was associated with reduced clustering and modularity
	and increased global efficiency of COS networks. Between-group differences
	in connection distance were localized specifically to connector hubs
	of multimodal association cortex. In relation to the neurodevelopmental
	pathogenesis of schizophrenia, we argue that the data are consistent
	with the interpretation that spatial and topological disturbances
	of functional network organization could arise from excessive "pruning"
	of short-distance functional connections in schizophrenia.},

	from a cohort of healthy young adults. Deterministic tractography

	were then derived by applying each of three widely used whole-brain
	parcellation schemes over a range of spatial resolutions. Across

	They also displayed signatures of topo-physical interdependence such
	as Rentian scaling. Basic connectivity properties and several graph
	metrics consistently displayed high reproducibility and low variability
	in both DSI and DTI networks. The relative increased sensitivity

  abstract = {The complex organization of connectivity in the human brain is incompletely
	understood. Recently, topological measures based on graph theory
	have provided a new approach to quantify large-scale cortical networks.
	These methods have been applied to anatomical connectivity data on
	nonhuman species, and cortical networks have been shown to have small-world
	topology, associated with high local and global efficiency of information
	transfer. Anatomical networks derived from cortical thickness measurements
	have shown the same organizational properties of the healthy human
	brain, consistent with similar results reported in functional networks
	derived from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging
	(MRI) and magnetoencephalographic data. Here we show, using anatomical
	networks derived from analysis of inter-regional covariation of gray
	matter volume in MRI data on 259 healthy volunteers, that classical
	divisions of cortex (multimodal, unimodal, and transmodal) have some
	distinct topological attributes. Although all cortical divisions
	shared nonrandom properties of small-worldness and efficient wiring
	(short mean Euclidean distance between connected regions), the multimodal
	network had a hierarchical organization, dominated by frontal hubs
	with low clustering, whereas the transmodal network was assortative.
	Moreover, in a sample of 203 people with schizophrenia, multimodal
	network organization was abnormal, as indicated by reduced hierarchy,
	the loss of frontal and the emergence of nonfrontal hubs, and increased
	connection distance. We propose that the topological differences
	between divisions of normal cortex may represent the outcome of different
	growth processes for multimodal and transmodal networks and that
	neurodevelopmental abnormalities in schizophrenia specifically impact
	multimodal cortical organization.},

  abstract = {The complexity of the human brain's activity and connectivity varies
	over temporal scales and is altered in disease states such as schizophrenia.
	Using a multi-level analysis of spontaneous low-frequency fMRI data
	stretching from the activity of individual brain regions to the coordinated
	connectivity pattern of the whole brain, we investigate the role
	of brain signal complexity in schizophrenia. Specifically, we quantitatively
	characterize the univariate wavelet entropy of regional activity,
	the bivariate pairwise functional connectivity between regions, and
	the multivariate network organization of connectivity patterns. Our
	results indicate that univariate measures of complexity are less
	sensitive to disease state than higher level bivariate and multivariate
	measures. While wavelet entropy is unaffected by disease state, the
	magnitude of pairwise functional connectivity is significantly decreased
	in schizophrenia and the variance is increased. Furthermore, by considering
	the network structure as a function of correlation strength, we find
	that network organization specifically of weak connections is strongly
	correlated with attention, memory, and negative symptom scores and
	displays potential as a clinical biomarker, providing up to 75\%
	classification accuracy and 85\% sensitivity. We also develop a general
	statistical framework for the testing of group differences in network

  abstract = {Reconstructing the macroscopic human cortical connectome by Diffusion
	Weighted Imaging (DWI) is a challenging research topic that has recently
	gained a lot of attention. In the present work, we investigate the
	effects of intra-voxel fiber direction modeling and tractography
	algorithm on derived structural network indices (e.g. density, small-worldness
	and global efficiency). The investigation is centered on three semi-independent
	distinctions within the large set of available diffusion models and
	tractography methods: i) single fiber direction versus multiple directions
	in the intra-voxel diffusion model, ii) deterministic versus probabilistic
	tractography and iii) local versus global measure-of-fit of the reconstructed
	fiber trajectories. The effect of algorithm and parameter choice
	has two components. First, there is the large effect of tractography
	algorithm and parameters on global network density, which is known
	to strongly affect graph indices. Second, and more importantly, there
	are remaining effects on graph indices which range in the tens of
	percent even when global density is controlled for. This is crucial
	for the sensitivity of any human structural network study and for
	the validity of study comparisons. We then investigate the effect
	of the choice of tractography algorithm on sensitivity and specificity
	of the resulting connections with a connectome dissection quality
	control (QC) approach. In this approach, evaluation of Tract Specific
	Density Coefficients (TSDCs) measures sensitivity while careful inspection

	by their mean volume. Specifically, two weighting schemes were adopted
	by considering various biases from fiber tracking. The weighting
	schemes were tested for possible bias toward the physical size of
	the nodes. A novel thresholding method was proposed using the variance
	of number of streamlines in fiber tracking. The backbone networks
	were extracted and various network analyses were applied to investigate
	the features of the binary and weighted backbone networks. For weighted
	networks, a high correlation was observed between nodal strength
	and betweenness centrality. Despite similar small-worldness features,
	binary networks and weighted networks are distinctive in many aspects,
	such as modularity and nodal betweenness centrality. Inter-subject
	variability was examined for the weighted networks, along with the
	test-retest reliability from two repeated scans on 44 of the 59 subjects.
	The inter-/intra-subject variability of weighted networks was discussed
	in three levels - edge weights, local metrics, and global metrics.
	The variance of edge weights can be very large. Although local metrics
	show less variability than the edge weights, they still have considerable
	amounts of variability. Weighting scheme one, which scales the number
	of streamlines by their lengths, demonstrates stable intra-class
	correlation coefficients against thresholding for global efficiency,
	clustering coefficient and diversity. The intra-class correlation
	analysis suggests the current approach of constructing weighted network
	has a reasonably high reproducibility for most global metrics.},

  abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been used for mapping the structural
	network of the human brain. The network can be constructed by choosing
	various brain regions as nodes and fiber tracts connecting those
	regions as links. The structural network generated from DTI data
	can be affected by noise in the scans and the choice of tractography
	algorithm. This study aimed to examine the effect of the number of
	seeds in tractography on the variance of structural networks. The
	variance of the network was characterized using an approach similar
	to the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) standards
	for measurement of image noise. It was shown that the variance of
	the network is inversely related to the square root of seed density.
	Consequently, the number of seeds has a large impact on local characteristics
	and metrics of the network architecture. As the number of seeds increased,
	increased stability of structural network metrics was observed. However,
	more seeds can also lead to more spurious fibers and thus affect
	nodal degrees and edge weights, and proper thresholding may be necessary
	to create an appropriate weighted network. Because the variance of
	the network is also influenced by other imaging factors, further
	increase in the number of seeds has little effect in reducing the
	network variance. The selection of the seed number should be a balance
	between the network variance and computational effort.},

	Here, we used a meta-analysis of the large primary literature that

	1985-2010). We estimated the similarity (Jaccard index) of the activation
	patterns across experimental tasks between each pair of 638 brain

	weighted graph to characterize network topology. The coactivation
	network was modular, with occipital, central, and default-mode modules
	predominantly coactivated by specific cognitive domains (perception,
	action, and emotion, respectively). It also included a rich club
	of hub nodes, located in parietal and prefrontal cortex and often
	connected over long distances, which were coactivated by a diverse
	range of experimental tasks. Investigating the topological role of
	edges between a deactivated and an activated node, we found that
	such competitive interactions were most frequent between nodes in
	different modules or between an activated rich-club node and a deactivated
	peripheral node. Many aspects of the coactivation network were convergent
	with a connectivity network derived from resting state fMRI data
	(n = 27, healthy volunteers); although the connectivity network was
	more parsimoniously connected and differed in the anatomical locations
	of some hubs. We conclude that the community structure of human brain
	networks is relevant to cognitive function. Deactivations may play
	a role in flexible reconfiguration of the network according to cognitive
	demand, varying the integration between modules, and between the
	periphery and a central rich club.},

  abstract = {Schizophrenia is frequently characterized as a disorder of brain connectivity.
	Neuroimaging has played a central role in supporting this view, with
	nearly two decades of research providing abundant evidence of structural
	and functional connectivity abnormalities in the disorder. In recent
	years, our understanding of how schizophrenia affects brain networks
	has been greatly advanced by attempts to map the complete set of
	inter-regional interactions comprising the brain's intricate web
	of connectivity; i.e., the human connectome. Imaging connectomics
	refers to the use of neuroimaging techniques to generate these maps
	which, combined with the application of graph theoretic methods,
	has enabled relatively comprehensive mapping of brain network connectivity
	and topology in unprecedented detail. Here, we review the application
	of these techniques to the study of schizophrenia, focusing principally
	on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) research, while drawing attention
	to key methodological issues in the field. The published findings
	suggest that schizophrenia is associated with a widespread and possibly
	context-independent functional connectivity deficit, upon which are
	superimposed more circumscribed, context-dependent alterations associated
	with transient states of hyper- and/or hypo-connectivity. In some
	cases, these changes in inter-regional functional coupling dynamics
	can be related to measures of intra-regional dysfunction. Topological
	disturbances of functional brain networks in schizophrenia point
	to reduced local network connectivity and modular structure, as well
	as increased global integration and network robustness. Some, but
	not all, of these functional abnormalities appear to have an anatomical
	basis, though the relationship between the two is complex. By comprehensively
	mapping connectomic disturbances in patients with schizophrenia across
	the entire brain, this work has provided important insights into
	the highly distributed character of neural abnormalities in the disorder,
	and the potential functional consequences that these disturbances
	entail.},

	Here we use a computational approach in an attempt to relate these

	that captures the large-scale interregional connections of macaque
	neocortex, and applying information theoretic measures to identify
	functional networks, we find structure-function relations at multiple
	temporal scales. Functional networks recovered from long windows
	of neural activity (minutes) largely overlap with the underlying
	structural network. As a result, hubs in these long-run functional
	networks correspond to structural hubs. In contrast, significant
	fluctuations in functional topology are observed across the sequence
	of networks recovered from consecutive shorter (seconds) time windows.
	The functional centrality of individual nodes varies across time
	as interregional couplings shift. Furthermore, the transient couplings
	between brain regions are coordinated in a manner that reveals the
	existence of two anticorrelated clusters. These clusters are linked
	by prefrontal and parietal regions that are hub nodes in the underlying
	structural network. At an even faster time scale (hundreds of milliseconds)
	we detect individual episodes of interregional phase-locking and
	find that slow variations in the statistics of these transient episodes,
	contingent on the underlying anatomical structure, produce the transfer
	entropy functional connectivity and simulated blood oxygenation level-dependent
	correlation patterns observed on slower time scales.},

	are continuously fluctuating. When neuronal activity, as measured
	using functional MRI (fMRI), is temporally coherent across 2 populations,
	those populations are said to be functionally connected. Functional
	connectivity has previously been shown to correlate with structural

	present study we investigate, with the aid of computational modeling,
	whether systems-level properties of functional networks--including
	their spatial statistics and their persistence across time--can be
	accounted for by properties of the underlying anatomical network.
	We measured resting state functional connectivity (using fMRI) and
	structural connectivity (using diffusion spectrum imaging tractography)
	in the same individuals at high resolution. Structural connectivity
	then provided the couplings for a model of macroscopic cortical dynamics.
	In both model and data, we observed (i) that strong functional connections
	commonly exist between regions with no direct structural connection,
	rendering the inference of structural connectivity from functional
	connectivity impractical; (ii) that indirect connections and interregional
	distance accounted for some of the variance in functional connectivity
	that was unexplained by direct structural connectivity; and (iii)
	that resting-state functional connectivity exhibits variability within
	and across both scanning sessions and model runs. These empirical
	and modeling results demonstrate that although resting state functional
	connectivity is variable and is frequently present between regions
	without direct structural linkage, its strength, persistence, and
	spatial statistics are nevertheless constrained by the large-scale
	anatomical structure of the human cerebral cortex.},

	To identify the linear relationships between all available pairs

	find that, although region-to-region correlations are extensively
	modulated by structural and connectomic measures, there are appreciable

  abstract = {Modern MRI image processing methods have yielded quantitative, morphometric,
	functional, and structural assessments of the human brain. These
	analyses typically exploit carefully optimized protocols for specific
	imaging targets. Algorithm investigators have several excellent public
	data resources to use to test, develop, and optimize their methods.
	Recently, there has been an increasing focus on combining MRI protocols
	in multi-parametric studies. Notably, these have included innovative
	approaches for fusing connectivity inferences with functional and/or
	anatomical characterizations. Yet, validation of the reproducibility
	of these interesting and novel methods has been severely hampered
	by the limited availability of appropriate multi-parametric data.
	We present an imaging protocol optimized to include state-of-the-art
	assessment of brain function, structure, micro-architecture, and
	quantitative parameters within a clinically feasible 60-min protocol
	on a 3-T MRI scanner. We present scan-rescan reproducibility of these
	imaging contrasts based on 21 healthy volunteers (11 M/10 F, 22-61
	years old). The cortical gray matter, cortical white matter, ventricular
	cerebrospinal fluid, thalamus, putamen, caudate, cerebellar gray
	matter, cerebellar white matter, and brainstem were identified with
	mean volume-wise reproducibility of 3.5\%. We tabulate the mean intensity,
	variability, and reproducibility of each contrast in a region of
	interest approach, which is essential for prospective study planning
	and retrospective power analysis considerations. Anatomy was highly
	consistent on structural acquisition (~1-5\% variability), while
	variation on diffusion and several other quantitative scans was higher
	(~<10\%). Some sequences are particularly variable in specific structures
	(ASL exhibited variation of 28\% in the cerebral white matter) or
	in thin structures (quantitative T2 varied by up to 73\% in the caudate)
	due, in large part, to variability in automated ROI placement. The
	richness of the joint distribution of intensities across imaging
	methods can be best assessed within the context of a particular analysis
	approach as opposed to a summary table. As such, all imaging data
	and analysis routines have been made publicly and freely available.
	This effort provides the neuroimaging community with a resource for
	optimization of algorithms that exploit the diversity of modern MRI
	modalities. Additionally, it establishes a baseline for continuing

	for the diagnosis, outcome prediction, and treatment monitoring of
	many common neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative
	disorders for which there is currently no clinical utility for MR
	imaging (MRI). Before computational network metrics from the human
	connectome can be applied in a clinical setting, their precision
	and their normative intersubject variation must be understood to
	guide the study design and the interpretation of longitudinal data.
	In this work, the reproducibility of commonly used graph theoretic
	measures is investigated, as applied to the structural connectome
	of healthy adult volunteers. Two datasets are examined, one consisting
	of 10 subjects scanned twice at one MRI facility and one consisting
	of five subjects scanned once each at two different facilities using
	the same imaging platform. Global graph metrics are calculated for
	unweighed and weighed connectomes, and two levels of granularity
	of the connectome are evaluated: one based on the 82-node cortical
	and subcortical parcellation from FreeSurfer and one based on an
	atlas-free parcellation of the gray-white matter boundary consisting
	of 1000 cortical nodes. The consistency of the unweighed and weighed
	edges and the module assignments are also computed for the 82-node
	connectomes. Overall, the results demonstrate good-to-excellent test-retest
	reliability for the entire connectome-processing pipeline, including
	the graph analytics, in both the intrasite and intersite datasets.
	These findings indicate that measurements of computational network
	metrics derived from the structural connectome have sufficient precision
	to be tested as potential biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and
	monitoring of interventions in neurological and psychiatric diseases.},

	three procedures to perform the automated anatomical labeling of
	functional studies are proposed: (1) labeling of an extremum defined
	by a set of coordinates, (2) percentage of voxels belonging to each
	of the AVOI intersected by a sphere centered by a set of coordinates,
	and (3) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the AVOI intersected
	by an activated cluster. An interface with the Statistical Parametric
	Mapping package (SPM, J. Ashburner and K. J. Friston, 1999, Hum.
	Brain Mapp. 7, 254-266) is provided as a freeware to researchers
	of the neuroimaging community. We believe that this tool is an improvement
	for the macroscopical labeling of activated area compared to labeling
	assessed using the Talairach atlas brain in which deformations are
	well known. However, this tool does not alleviate the need for more
	sophisticated labeling strategies based on anatomical or cytoarchitectonic
	probabilistic maps.},

	of topological properties in large scale networks including the human
	brain. Information on structural networks in the brain can be obtained
	in-vivo by performing tractography on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
	data. However, little is known about the reproducibility of network
	properties derived from whole brain tractography data, which has
	important consequences for minimally detectable abnormalities or
	changes over time. Moreover, acquisition parameters, such as the
	number of gradient directions and gradient strength, possibly influence
	network metrics and the corresponding reproducibility derived from
	tractography data. The aim of the present study is twofold: (i) to
	determine the effect of several clinically available DTI sampling
	schemes, differing in number of gradient directions and gradient
	amplitude, on small world metrics and (ii) to evaluate the interscan
	reproducibility of small world metrics. DTI experiments were conducted
	on six healthy volunteers scanned twice. Probabilistic tractography
	was performed to reconstruct structural connections between regions
	defined from an anatomical atlas. The observed reproducibility of
	the network measures was high, reflected by low values for the coefficient
	of variation (<3.8\%), advocating the use of graph theoretical measurements
	to study neurological diseases. Small world metrics were dependent
	on the choice of DTI gradient scheme and showed stronger connectivity
	with increasing directional resolution. The interscan reproducibility
	was not dependent on the gradient scheme. These findings should be
	considered when comparing results across studies using different
	gradient schemes or designing new studies.},

  abstract = {Graph theory is a valuable framework to study the organization of
	functional and anatomical connections in the brain. Its use for comparing
	network topologies, however, is not without difficulties. Graph measures
	may be influenced by the number of nodes (N) and the average degree
	(k) of the network. The explicit form of that influence depends on
	the type of network topology, which is usually unknown for experimental
	data. Direct comparisons of graph measures between empirical networks
	with different N and/or k can therefore yield spurious results. We
	list benefits and pitfalls of various approaches that intend to overcome
	these difficulties. We discuss the initial graph definition of unweighted
	graphs via fixed thresholds, average degrees or edge densities, and
	the use of weighted graphs. For instance, choosing a threshold to
	fix N and k does eliminate size and density effects but may lead
	to modifications of the network by enforcing (ignoring) non-significant
	(significant) connections. Opposed to fixing N and k, graph measures
	are often normalized via random surrogates but, in fact, this may
	even increase the sensitivity to differences in N and k for the commonly
	used clustering coefficient and small-world index. To avoid such
	a bias we tried to estimate the N,k-dependence for empirical networks,
	which can serve to correct for size effects, if successful. We also
	add a number of methods used in social sciences that build on statistics
	of local network structures including exponential random graph models
	and motif counting. We show that none of the here-investigated methods
	allows for a reliable and fully unbiased comparison, but some perform
	better than others.},

	middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing
	amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered,

	like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy
	with the small-world phenomenon (popularly known as six degrees of
	separation. The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans,
	the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration
	graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models

  abstract = {AlzheimerÂs disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. As

	underlying the disease are not thoroughly understood. In recent years,
	non-invasive neuroimaging and neurophysiological techniques (e.g.,
	structural MRI, diffusion MRI, functional MRI and EEG/MEG) and graph
	theory based network analysis have provided a new perspective on
	structural and functional connectivity patterns of the human brain
	(i.e., the human connectome) in health and disease. Using these powerful
	approaches, several recent studies of patients with AD exhibited
	abnormal topological organization in both global and regional properties
	of neuronal networks, indicating that AD not only affects specific
	brain regions, but also alters the structural and functional associations
	between distinct brain regions. Specifically, disruptive organization
	in the whole-brain networks in AD is involved in the loss of small-world
	characters and the re-organization of hub distributions. These aberrant
	neuronal connectivity patterns were associated with cognitive deficits
	in patients with AD, even with genetic factors in healthy aging.
	These studies provide empirical evidence to support the existence
	of an aberrant connectome of AD. In this review we will summarize
	recent advances discovered in large-scale brain network studies of
	AD, mainly focusing on graph theoretical analysis of brain connectivity
	abnormalities. These studies provide novel insights into the pathophysiological
	mechanisms of AD and could be helpful in developing imaging biomarkers
